# Keylogger
This is a program that captures keystrokes and sends them to a specified email address every 24 hours.

## Prevention
* Use a reputable antivirus software
* Be careful when downloading files or clicking on links from unknown sources
* Keep your operating system and software up to date
* Use a password manager
* Use a firewall

It is important to note that creating and distributing a keylogger is illegal in most jurisdictions without the explicit consent of the users being monitored. It is also considered unethical to use such a program without proper authorization.
